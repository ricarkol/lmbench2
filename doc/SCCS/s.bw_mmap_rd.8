.SH NAME
bw_mmap_rd \- time the reading and summing of a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bw_mmap_rd
.I size
.I file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bw_mmap_rd
creates a memory mapping to the file and then reads the mapping in an unrolled
loop similar to that used in bw_mem_rd(8).
The benchmark is intended to be used on a file 
that is in memory, i.e., the benchmark is a reread benchmark.  Other
file benchmarking can be done with 
.BR lmdd (8).
.LP
The size
specification may end with ``k'' or ``m'' to mean
kilobytes (* 1024) or megabytes (* 1024 * 1024).
.SH OUTPUT
Output format is \f(CB"%0.2f %.2f\\n", megabytes, megabytes_per_second\fP, i.e.,
.sp
.ft CB
8.00 25.33
.ft
.SH MEMORY UTILIZATION
This benchmark should move approximately the reported amount of memory.
.SH ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
Funding for the development of
this tool was provided by Sun Microsystems Computer Corporation.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
