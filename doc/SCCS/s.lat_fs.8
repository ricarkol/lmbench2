.SH DESCRIPTION
D 3
.B lat_connect
is a client/server program that measures interprocess
connection latencies.   The benchmark times the creation and connection of
an AF_INET (aka TCP/IP) socket to a remote server.  Care is take that the
connection time does not include any other overhead, such as the
\fIgethostbyname()\fP or remote port lookups since these add more overhead
than the connection establishment itself.
.LP
.B lat_connect
has three forms of usage: as a server (-s), as a client (lat_connect localhost),
and as a shutdown (lat_connect -localhost).
E 3
I 3
.B lat_fs
is a program that creates a number of small files in the current working
directory and then removes the files.  Both the creation and removal of 
the files is timed.

.SH OPTIONS
If
.I dir
is specified,
.B lat_fs
will change to that directory first and do the creates and deletes there.
Otherwise the creates and deletes are done in $PWD.

.SH OUTPUT
D 3
The reported time is in microseconds per connection.
Output format is like so
E 3
I 3
The results are in terms of creates per second and deletes per second
as a function of file size.  The output is in 4 column form and is the
size of the file, the number created, the creations per second, and the
removals per second.  Output format looks like:
