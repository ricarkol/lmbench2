.TH LAT_MEM_RD 8 "$Date$" "(c)1994 Larry McVoy" "LMBENCH"
.SH NAME
lat_mem_rd \- memory read latency benchmark
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lat_mem_rd 
.I size_in_megabytes
.I stride [stride stride...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lat_mem_rd
measures memory read latency for varying memory sizes and strides.  The
D 3
results are reported in nanoseconds per load
and have been verified accurate to within
1/2 of the processor cycle time (i.e., 20 ns on a 40ns cycle time).
E 3
I 3
results are reported in nanoseconds per load and have been verified
accurate to within a few nanoseconds on an SGI Indy.

The
entire memory hierarchy is measured, including onboard cache latency
and size, external cache latency and size, main memory latency, and TLB
miss latency.

.SH OUTPUT
Output format is intended as input to \fBxgraph\fP or some similar program.
The format is multi line, the first line is a title that specifies the
size and non-context switching overhead of the test.  Each subsequent 
line is a pair of numbers that indicates the number of processes and 
the cost of a context switch.  The overhead and the context switch times are
in micro second units.  The numbers below are for a SPARCstation 2.

I 3
Only data accesses are measured; the instruction cache is not measured.
.LP
The benchmark runs as two nested loops.  The outer loop is the stride size.
The inner loop is the array size.  For each array size, the benchmark
creates a ring of pointers that point forward one stride.  Traversing the
array is done by

in a for loop (the over head of the for loop is not significant; the loop is 
an unrolled loop 1000 loads long).  The loop stops after doing a million loads.
.LP
The size of the array varies from 512 bytes to (typically) eight megabytes.
For the small sizes, the cache will have an effect, and the loads will be
much faster.  This becomes much more apparent when the data is plotted.
.SH OUTPUT
Output format is intended as input to \fBxgraph\fP or some similar program
(I use a perl script that produces pic input).
There is a set of data produced for each stride.  The data set title
is the stride size and the data points are the array size in megabytes 
(floating point value) and the load latency over all points in that array.
.SH "INTERPRETING THE OUTPUT"
The output is best examined in a graph where you typically get a graph
that has four plateaus.  The graph should plotted in log base 2 of the
array size on the X axis and the latency on the Y axis.  Each stride
is then plotted as a curve.  The plateaus that appear correspond to 
the onboard cache (if present), external cache (if present), main
memory latency, and TLB miss latency.
.LP
As a rough guide, you may be able to extract the latencies of the
various parts as follows, but you should really look at the graphs,
since these rules of thumb do not always work (some systems do not
have onboard cache, for example).
.IP "onboard cache" 16
Try stride of 128 and array size of .00098.
.IP "external cache" 
Try stride of 128 and array size of .125.
.IP "main memory"
Try stride of 128 and array size of 8.
.IP "TLB miss"
Try the largest stride and the largest array.

.SH BUGS
This program is dependent on the correct operation of
.BR mhz (8).
If you are getting numbers that seem off, check that 
.BR mhz (8)
is giving you a clock rate that you believe.
