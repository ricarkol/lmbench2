.SH NAME
bw_mem_wr \- time memory write rate (with overhead)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bw_mem_wr
.I size
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bw_mem_wr
allocates the specified amount of memory, zeros it, and then times the
writing of that memory as a series of 4 byte integer stores and increments.  
.LP
The size
specification may end with ``k'' or ``m'' to mean
kilobytes (* 1024) or megabytes (* 1024 * 1024).
.SH OUTPUT
Output format is \f(CB"%0.2f %.2f\\n", megabytes, megabytes_per_second\fP, i.e.,
.sp
.ft CB
8.00 25.33
.ft
.SH MEMORY UTILIZATION
This benchmark can move up to twice the requested memory.  A processor store
is usually implemented as a read cache line, modify the cache line, and 
store the cache line (now or later, depending on cache write back policy).
