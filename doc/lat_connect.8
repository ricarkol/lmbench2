.SH NAME
lat_connect \- measure interprocess connection latency via TCP/IP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lat_connect
.I -s
.sp .5
.B lat_connect
.I hostname
.sp .5
.B lat_connect
.I -hostname
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lat_connect
is a client/server program that measures interprocess
connection latencies.   The benchmark times the creation and connection of
an AF_INET (aka TCP/IP) socket to a remote server.  Care is take that the
connection time does not include any other overhead, such as the
\fIgethostbyname()\fP or remote port lookups since these add more overhead
than the connection establishment itself.
.LP
.B lat_connect
has three forms of usage: as a server (-s), as a client (lat_connect localhost),
and as a shutdown (lat_connect -localhost).
.SH OUTPUT
The reported time is in microseconds per connection.
Output format is like so
.sp
.ft CB
TCP/IP connection cost to localhost: 1006 microseconds
